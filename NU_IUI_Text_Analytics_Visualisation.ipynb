        "Text visualization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the use of graphical or visual representations to depict and convey information extracted from textual data. It serves as a powerful tool for making sense of large volumes of text, revealing patterns, relationships, and insights that might be challenging to discern through traditional text-based analysis alone. Text visualization techniques help researchers, analysts, and decision-makers gain a more intuitive and comprehensive understanding of textual data.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are going to use WordCloud library to generate a word cloud visualization from a given text in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Libraries Used:\n",
        "**'numpy'** is imported as **'np'**. Although not used in this specific code, it's a common practice to import **'numpy'** as **'np'** for mathematical operations.\n",
        "**matplotlib.pyplot** is imported as **'plt'** to create and display the word cloud visualization.\n",
        "**WordCloud** and **STOPWORDS** are imported from the **'wordcloud'** library. **WordCloud** is the primary class for generating word clouds, and **STOPWORDS** contains a set of common English words that are often excluded from word clouds because they don't convey significant meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**generate_wordcloud** is a function that takes one argument, **'text'**, which is the input text from which the word cloud will be generated. It first creates a set of stopwords using the **STOPWORDS** set from the **wordcloud** library. These stopwords are words like \"the,\" \"is,\" \"and,\" etc., which are typically filtered out of word clouds. Then, it initializes a **WordCloud** object with the following parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> **background_color='white'**: Sets the background color of the word cloud to white.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**stopwords=stopwords**: Specifies the set of stopwords to be used.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**max_words=200**: Limits the maximum number of words to be displayed in the word cloud to 200.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**max_font_size=40**: Sets the maximum font size for words in the word cloud to 40.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**random_state=42**: Provides seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the word cloud layout.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The WordCloud object is then used to generate the word cloud from the input text and is displayed using **matplotlib.pyplot** with a specified figure size, and the imshow function is used to show the word cloud. **plt.axis('off')** removes the axis labels and ticks from the plot, and **plt.show()** displays the plot\n",
        "\n",
        "sample_text is the variable containing the sample text from which the word cloud will be generated. It is a multi-line string containing a description. You can replace this static text input with real-time text sources or other text files with large content.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we run this code, it will generate a word cloud based on the words in the sample_text and display it as a graphical representation where the most frequent words will be larger and more prominent in the visualization."

This could be place names, addresses, coordinates, or even contextual information related to places. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a common NLP task for extracting such named entities, including locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Geocoding:** After extracting place names, these need to be converted to geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for visualization. This process is called geocoding and often involves third-party services or datasets. Conversely, reverse geocoding converts coordinates back to human-readable place names.\n",

        "**Spatial Analysis:** Once you have location-based data, you can perform spatial analysis. This can involve understanding proximity, calculating distances between points, determining clusters, or understanding movement patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Visualization:** The location-based data can be visualized on maps using markers, heatmaps, lines, or polygons. This helps in deriving insights related to spatial distribution, trends, or patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Application are **Travel Blogs or Diaries** (Extract and visualize places mentioned in a travelogue to trace the journey on a map)\n",
        "**News Analysis** (Identify and visualize the geographic distribution of news events or stories)\n",
        "**Social Media Analysis** (Understand where users are talking about specific topics by analyzing geotagged tweets or posts)\n",
        "**Literature or Historical Analysis** (Map places mentioned in historical documents or novels to get a spatial understanding of events or narratives)\n",

        "Lets deal with this task as a solution for problem statemnt\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement: Geospatial Visualization of Personal Travel Diary**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background:**\n",
        "In the age of digital content and blogging, many individuals document their travel experiences in digital formats such as blogs, online journals, or social media posts. These textual narrations often include dates and names of places visited. While these narratives are rich in detail, they lack an interactive and visual perspective that would allow readers or the authors themselves to visually trace their journey over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:**\n",
        "Develop a tool that extracts mentions of dates and places from a given textual travel diary and then visualizes these visits on an interactive map. The visual representation should allow users to see the sequence of visits as they happened over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Requirements:**\n",
        "The tool should accept a multiline text input describing travel experiences with mentions of dates and places.\n",
        "The tool should be able to recognize and extract date and place mentions from the given input.\n",
        "For each recognized place, the tool should determine its geographical coordinates.\n",
        "The tool should visualize the extracted places on an interactive map.\n",
        "The visual representation on the map should be timestamped, allowing for an animated playback of the travel journey.\n",
        "Each place on the map should have a distinct visual representation (e.g., different colors) to distinguish between the various visits.\n",
        "The resultant map should be saved as an interactive HTML file for easy sharing and viewing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Constraints:**\n",
        "The initial version of the tool should focus on places located in the UK.\n",
        "The tool should respect rate limits when fetching geographical coordinates to avoid overloading geocoding services.\n",
        "The tool should handle scenarios where a place's geographical coordinates cannot be determined.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Desired Outcome:**\n",
        "At the end of this project, a user should be able to provide a text-based travel diary and receive an interactive geospatial visualization in HTML format, illustrating their journey across the UK over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code below provided is the solution for the above stated application, it creates an interactive geospatial visualization to depict the sequence of places visited by a person in the UK, as mentioned in the input_text. The resulting map animates through the sequence of visits with different colored points for each location.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Code description is provided below.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Libraries Used:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**folium:** A Python library for creating interactive maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TimestampedGeoJson:** A plugin for folium to visualize data with timestamps.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Nominatim:** A geocoding service from the geopy library that converts place names to latitude and longitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "**datetime and time:** Python built-in libraries for date and time operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**re:** Python built-in library for regular expression operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**input_text:** A multi-line string containing dates followed by place names.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **re.findall()** function uses a regular expression to extract dates, verbs (e.g., \"visited\", \"went\"), and place names from **input_text**.\n",
        "\n",
        "For converting Place Names to Latitude and Longitude, the code initializes the **Nominatim** geolocator. For each extracted place name, the geolocator gets the latitude and longitude. A **time.sleep(1)** is used to prevent hitting the geolocator's rate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "A base map centered around the UK is created using **folium.Map()**.\n",
        "\n",
        "For timestamped data Preparation, the code prepares data to be visualized as points with timestamps. Each location and its associated date are matched with a color from the predefined list of colors.\n",
        "The **data** dictionary, formatted as GeoJSON, contains each place as a feature with a point geometry (latitude and longitude) and properties (timestamp and visualization style).\n",
        "\n",
        "For Adding Timestamped Data to the Map, we use the **TimestampedGeoJson** plugin is used to visualize the data points with timestamps on the base map. The period is set to \"P1D\" which means 1 day, so the data points will be visualized one day at a time. Various other parameters control the appearance and behaviour of the timeline slider.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the interactive map with the visualized timeline is saved to an HTML file named **\"Visited_Places_Geospatial_Visualization_v2.html\"**.\n"
