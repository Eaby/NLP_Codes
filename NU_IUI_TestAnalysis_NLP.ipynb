        "# **Task 1 : Text Preprocessing**\n",
        "\n",
        "In text preprocessing, various steps and techniques applied to raw text data before it is used for analysis or machine learning tasks. The primary purpose of text preprocessing is to clean, normalize, and transform the raw text into a format that is suitable for further NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Main aspects of text preprocessing are as follow:\n",
        ">**Text Cleaning:**\n",
        "\n",
        ">>**Noise Removal:** This involves removing irrelevant characters, symbols, and formatting issues from the text, such as HTML tags, special characters, and extra white spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>**Lowercasing:** Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency in text analysis, as \"word\" and \"Word\" should be treated as the same word.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>**Spell Checking and Correction:** Correcting common spelling errors to improve text quality.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Tokenization:**\n",
        "Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. It's a fundamental step for most NLP tasks. For example, the sentence \"I love NLP\" would be tokenized into [\"I\", \"love\", \"NLP\"].\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Stopword Removal:**\n",
        "Stopwords are common words (e.g., \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is\") that often do not carry significant meaning and can be safely removed from text to reduce dimensionality and improve processing efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Stemming and Lemmatization:**\n",
        "Stemming involves reducing words to their root or base form (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\"). Lemmatization, on the other hand, reduces words to their dictionary or lemma form (e.g., \"better\" to \"good\"). These techniques help in reducing inflected words to their common form.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Removing Special Characters and Punctuation:**\n",
        "Removing non-alphanumeric characters and punctuation marks that do not carry meaningful information for many NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Normalization:**\n",
        "Ensuring consistent representation of text, such as converting abbreviations (\"U.S.A.\" to \"USA\"), handling contractions (\"can't\" to \"cannot\"), and converting numbers to words or vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Handling HTML Tags and URLs:**\n",
        "Stripping HTML tags from web content and handling URLs appropriately by converting them to a common format or removing them.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Handling Emoji and Emoticons:**\n",
        "Dealing with emojis and emoticons, either by removing them or converting them to textual representations.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Text Encoding:**\n",
        "Converting text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models, often using techniques like one-hot encoding or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).\n",
        "\n",
        "Text preprocessing plays a crucial role in NLP because the quality of the data used for analysis or modeling directly impacts the performance and accuracy of NLP applications, including text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. By carefully preprocessing text data, NLP practitioners can ensure that the text is in a clean and standardized format, making it easier for models to learn meaningful patterns and relationships within the data."

TextBlob is a convenient wrapper for working with text data, providing various text processing capabilities. A method called **blob.sentiment** performs the sentiment analysis on the input text. The polarity of the sentiment (how positive or negative the text is) is extracted from the sentiment tuple. Polarity ranges from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive). The subjectivity of the sentiment (how subjective or objective the text is) is also extracted. Subjectivity ranges from 0 (very objective) to 1 (very subjective). From the  polarity value, the code classifies the sentiment into one of three categories: \"Positive,\" \"Negative,\" or \"Neutral.\" If polarity is greater than 0, it's labeled as \"Positive\"; if less than 0, it's labeled as \"Negative\"; otherwise, it's labeled as \"Neutral.\" Finally, the code prints out the original text, the determined sentiment label, the polarity score, and the subjectivity score.\n"

        "We will be using a different library called spaCy for NER. The below code begins by importing the spaCy library, which is a popular natural language processing (NLP) library in Python used for various text processing tasks. It loads the spaCy English language model 'en_core_web_sm.' This model contains pre-trained word vectors and linguistic rules for the English language. The **nlp** object (the spaCy model) is used to process the input text. When you process text with spaCy, it tokenizes the text, performs part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition, among other tasks. The code extracts named entities and their associated labels from the processed text. Named entities are phrases or words in the text that refer to specific, identifiable objects, such as names of people, places, organizations, dates, and more. Each named entity is paired with a label that categorizes it, such as 'PERSON' for names of individuals or 'ORG' for names of organizations. The code iterates through the extracted named entities and their labels and prints them to the console. For each entity-label pair, it prints both the entity text and its associated label."

        "\n",
        "Topic modelling is a technique used to discover abstract topics within a collection of text documents. The primary goal is to uncover latent topics or themes within a set of documents without requiring prior knowledge or manual labelling. It helps to organize and understand the underlying structure of a text corpus.\n",
        "One popular algorithm for topic modelling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We can use the gensim library in Python to perform topic modelling using LDA. LDA assumes that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words. The algorithm iteratively identifies these topics and the distribution of words within them. In topic modelling, a \"topic\" is not a single word but rather a collection of words that are related and tend to co-occur within documents. These topics are represented as word distributions, showing the probability of each word belonging to a particular topic.\n",

        "\n",
        "Text summarization is a broad topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and there are various ways to approach it. A common method is to use extractive summarization, where sentences are ranked based on their importance and then the top sentences are extracted to form a summary. In other words we can say text summarization is to create a shorter, coherent, and informative summary of a longer document, such as an article, research paper, or news article. The summary should capture the essential points, main ideas, and key details while removing redundant or less relevant content. We mainly have 2 types of summarizations, one is Extractive Summarization and the ther other is Abstractive Summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extractive Summarization involes selecting and extracting sentences or phrases directly from the original text that are deemed most important. Extractive summarization relies on ranking and selecting existing content and is often based on sentence importance scores. Where as Abstractive Summarization goes beyond mere extraction and generates summaries in a more human-like way. It involves paraphrasing and rephrasing the content to create concise and coherent summaries. Abstractive summarization typically requires more advanced natural language generation techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Applications:**\n",
        "\n",
        ">> **Information Retrieval:** Summaries make it easier for users to quickly understand the content of long documents or web pages.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>**News Summarization:** Automatically generating brief news summaries from longer articles or news feeds.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>**Document Summarization:** Creating abstracts or executive summaries for research papers, reports, and legal documents.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>**Content Generation:** Generating concise descriptions for product listings or search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text summarization is a valuable tool for processing and distilling large volumes of text data, making it more digestible and accessible for readers, researchers, and applications that require concise information extraction from textual sources.\n",

        "The **build_similarity_matrix** function takes a list of sentences as input.\n",
        "It uses scikit-learn's **TfidfVectorizer** to convert the sentences into a TF-IDF matrix. TF-IDF represents the importance of each word in the context of the entire text.\n",
        "The code then calculates the cosine similarity between each pair of sentences based on their TF-IDF representations. This results in a similarity matrix.\n",

        "The **summarize_text** function takes the input text and an optional parameter **num_sentences** (default is 5) to specify the number of sentences in the summary.\n",
        "It tokenizes the input text into sentences using NLTK's sentence tokenizer.\n",
        "Each sentence is preprocessed by removing stopwords.\n",
        "The TF-IDF-based similarity matrix is calculated for these preprocessed sentences.\n",
        "A sentence similarity graph is constructed from the similarity matrix using NetworkX.\n",
        "PageRank is applied to the sentence similarity graph to rank the sentences based on their importance in the context of the entire text.\n",
        "Finally, the code generates a summary by selecting the top-ranked sentences according to PageRank and joins them to form the summarized text.\n",
